#RESTORE 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: KERNAL

### Team Members
- Member 1: HANA HARIS - COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING THALASSERY


### Hosted Project Link
https://hanahehe.github.io/restore/

### Project Description
This project is a smart campus logistics platform that streamlines student life by providing real-time inventory tracking for college stores and a pre-booking system for the canteen. It empowers students to influence store restocking through a crowdsourced demand feature and eliminates long food queues via QR-code-based meal collection.

### The Problem statement
This project solves campus logistics friction by eliminating wasted trips for out-of-stock stationery through demand-driven restocking and ending long canteen queues via QR-code pre-booking with peak-hour load balancing.

### The Solution
Crowdsourced Restocking: Enables students to "Request" out-of-stock items, providing vendors with a data-driven replenishment list.

QR-Code Pre-booking: Eliminates canteen queues by shifting ordering to a "grab-and-go" digital system.

Traffic Load Balancing: Uses a Peak Hour Predictor to alert students of high-volume times, ensuring smoother service for both kitchen staff and hungry students.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
